## Briefing
> Download the file and find a way to get the flag.

## Solution
The provided file can be found [here](fm02.zip).

- Notice the IRC conversation in stream 57, and read it by following the TCP stream (`tcp.stream eq 57`)
- Observe the discussion of a 7zip file
- We could properly trace the DCC exchange, but it's far simpler to just search for the hex string `37 7a bc` (the 7zip file header, see [file signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) for file headers) in all packets.
- Packet #2863 matches, so we follow that stream (`tcp.stream eq 79`)
- Save it out as raw bytes, then convert the hex back to a file, and rename to `.7z`
- The password we need was in the original IRC conversation, base64 encoded, so we can decode it to get the password
  - `TWFyaW9SdWxlejE5ODU=` = `MarioRulez1985`
- We can either `strings` the file we extracted, or just open it in a text editor, to find the flag.
